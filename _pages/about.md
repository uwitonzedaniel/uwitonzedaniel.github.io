Hi, I’m Azamuke Denish and I specialize in Mobile Applications. I’m passionate about what I do, and I love to help people. Nothing is more fulfilling than being part of a team with similar interests, and an organization that values its people.

I am passionate about App Development and communities. I just enjoy working on new ideas. Also work as smart as possible. I love to do creative apps. I am always ready to learn new things and help people, organisations and companies however due to large volume of requests, i give attention to paid requests.

I studied Bachelor of science in computer science at Makerere University from 2016 to 2019. In July 3rd - 4th 2019, I was able to represent Makerere University at The Africa Blockchain Conference, Kampala Serena Conference Centre. I also represented the University in many exhibitions in Kampala.

Being 100% perfect in the sight of everyman is hard, but making up high quality designs is fun. I made this site so that I can balance the two.

Nothing brings me more pleasure than making something out of nothing. Even when the results are far from my ideal expectations, I find the whole ceremony of creativity completely enthralling.

I'd like to think that I'm very happy person, but I find the art that strikes me truest is the sad, depressing sort, I love hip-hop and R&B music, post-apocalyptic fiction, and movie trailers that can make me squirt tears in under two minutes. Go figure.
